# Montys_Doors_App
This is application is a simple game based off the Monty Hall Problem which is described as "The Monty Hall problem is named for its similarity to the Let's Make a Deal television game show hosted by Monty Hall. The problem is stated as follows. Assume that a room is equipped with three doors. Behind two are goats, and behind the third is a shiny new car. You are asked to pick a door, and will win whatever is behind it. Let's say you pick door 1. Before the door is opened, however, someone who knows what's behind the doors (Monty Hall) opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat, and asks you if you wish to change your selection to the third door (i.e., the door which neither you picked nor he opened). The Monty Hall problem is deciding whether you do." (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MontyHallProblem.html)

### Coding Style
All I used was python and kivy.

### Installing
You'll need kivy installed for the project interpreter and to build the app.
Here is a link I used to help me get started: https://www.reddit.com/r/kivy/wiki/quick_start_windows 
The link listed is helpful for windows users as I am a windows user. Sorry for the inconvience for any other OS users.

## Acknowledgement
The state of the application is far from finish and I have a few ideas that I have up my sleeve, but I am open to any helpful contributions.
